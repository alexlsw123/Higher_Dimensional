# Higher_Dimensional
## Discovering the structure of higher dimensional data

## Data

**NOTE: Data file is not available due to confidentiality!**

The data contains 17404 rows with a list of 6-dimensional coordinates within a cube of side length 100.

## Task
### Using Spark, what features can we discover in a 6-dimensional data set?

My job is to identify actual structure of the 6-dimensional data provided. This was done by extracting the data into 1, 2, and 3-dimensional objects by doing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Result

My code produces a total of 12 plots (Non-PCA and PCA plots for each cluster). The `pdf` file in the repository does a great job of showing the result.
